 <li><b>Sentence Structures</b>: Understanding the different ways words can be arranged in a sentence is key to effective communication. We will explore sentence structures, including simple, compound, complex, and compound-complex sentences.</li>
  
 <li><b>Punctuation</b>: Punctuation marks play a vital role in indicating the pause, tone, or intent of spoken words. We will explore the various punctuation marks in English and their correct usage.</li>
  
 <li><b>Grammar Rules</b>: While there are no hard-and-fast rules, English grammar is generally considered "lazy". This means that it follows certain patterns or rules to minimize confusion. We will explore some common grammar rules, including contractions, negatives, questions, and relative clauses.</li>
